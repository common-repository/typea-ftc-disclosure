Add FTC-Compliant Disclosure statement to the beginning of your blog posts

== Description ==

The FTC requires that publishers (which includes bloggers) disclose their relationships with brands if they earn any compensation (including free products, affiliate income or being paid to write about a brand) from these brands. This plugin gives you the ability to quickly and easily add an FTC-compliant disclosure statement on your blog posts.
